# Sanchari Biswas

**AI & Systems Engineer | LLM & RAG Researcher | Network Systems Specialist**

I design intelligent systems that bridge large language models, structured data, and real-world infrastructure.  
My work spans prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), network policy modeling, distributed systems, and production-scale platforms.

With a Master’s in Computer Science (2024) and a background in Telecommunications, I bring experience across AI research, enterprise network systems, and backend engineering.
